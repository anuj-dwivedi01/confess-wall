🕵️‍♂️ Anonymous Confession Wall
A safe space for honest expression — anonymously, securely, and with empathy.

🔍 How It Works
Users visit the Confess page and submit a message anonymously.
The message is stored in the browser’s localStorage and redirected to the Home page.
Confessions are dynamically rendered with:
❤️ Like functionality
💬 Comment sections
🗑️ Option to delete entries (for demo/testing)
Data remains persistent unless manually cleared.
